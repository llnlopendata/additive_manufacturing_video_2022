Data Exploration with Machine Learning for Additive Manufacturing, video dataset
===

Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a widely used 3D nanoprinting technique that uses laser light to create objects. Challenges to large-scale adoption of this additive manufacturing method include identifying light dosage parameters and monitoring during fabrication. A research team from [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov/), Iowa State University, and Georgia Tech is applying machine learning models to tackle these challenges—i.e., accelerate the process of identifying optimal light dosage parameters and automate the detection of part quality. Funded by LLNL’s Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program, the project team has curated a video dataset of TPL processes for parameters such as light dosages, photo-curable resins, and structures. Both raw and labeled versions of the datasets are available on the links in the [Open Data Initiative page](https://data-science.llnl.gov/open-data-initiative). 

The data exploration code included uses the labeled dataset.
